Moody Matcha Systems Recommendation & Analysis

Overview:
This contains a systems analysis and recommendation project completed as part of the MIS coursework. 
The project evaluates the business and technical needs of Moody Matcha, a small matcha-based beverage vendor, and proposes a scalable information system solution to support growth.
The work focuses on identifying operational pain points, evaluating system alternatives, and recommending a cost-effective, low-risk solution that aligns with the client’s current stage and long-term goals.

Project Objective:
Moody Matcha relied almost entirely on Instagram for customer communication, event bookings, and business inquiries. This created challenges around organization, scalability, professionalism, and customer experience.

The objective of this project was to:
- Analyze the current business process and pain points
- Evaluate technical, economic, operational, and schedule feasibility
- Compare multiple system alternatives
- Recommend a system that improves efficiency, organization, and brand presence

Proposed Solution:
The recommended solution is a web-based information system built using WordPress, designed to complement Instagram.

Key capabilities include:
- Business information (menu, mission, events)
- Contact and booking request forms
- Event calendar and inquiry tracking
- Email notifications and confirmations
- Mobile-first, user-friendly design
- External payment handling, such as CashApp, Zelle, Venmo, to reduce risk and complexity
